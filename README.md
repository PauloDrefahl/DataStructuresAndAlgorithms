## Data Structures
This section includes implementations of common data structures, such as:
- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Hash Tables**
## Algorithms
This section covers key algorithmic topics, including:
- **Sorting Algorithms** (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- **Searching Algorithms** (e.g., Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- **Dynamic Programming** (e.g., Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem)
- **Greedy Algorithms** (e.g., Activity Selection, Huffman Encoding)
- **Graph Algorithms** (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm)
## Installation
To get started with this repository, clone the project locally using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/paulodrefahl/data-structures-algorithms-practice.git
```
Then navigate into the project directory:
